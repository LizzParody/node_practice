##instal gulp
```
npm install gulp --save
(enter)
```
It will create a folder called "node_modules"
In the text editor it will look like this:
```
"dependencies": {
  "gulp": "^3.9.0"
}
```

The folder of "node_modules" doesn't have to be shared when you send the project somewhere else.

I can delete the folder, and go back to the terminal and type

```javascript
npm install // This would read all the packages that I have installed and reinstall any dependency.
```
